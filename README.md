# Multi-Layer-Perceptron
*****************************

A simple neural network in C programming is implemented by me (Rahul Kumar  rahul.k16@iiits.in) and my helpful teammate (Mrityunjay Kumar Ojha  mrityunjaykumar.o16@iiits.in) during March 2018.

It is mainly aimed at implementing a neural network learning component into a working system.Obviously there are many types of neural network one could consider using - here I shall concentrate on one particularly common and useful type, namely :
    •	A simple fully-connected feed-forward back-propagation network (multi layer perceptron)
    •	Consisting of an input layer, one hidden layer and an output layer.
    •	Cross-entropy  is also used as loss function.


This type of network will be useful when we have a set of input vectors and a corresponding set of output vectors, and the aim is for the network to produce an appropriate output for each input it is given. Of course, if we already have a complete noise-free set of input and output vectors, then a simple look-up table would suffice. However, if we want the system to generalize, i.e. produce appropriate outputs for inputs that have never been seen before, then a neural network that has learned how to map between the known inputs and outputs (i.e. the training data set) will often do a pretty good job for new inputs as well, particularly if an appropriate regularization technique has been used.
